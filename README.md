# AboutMe
I am a first year Robotic Systems Engineering Student at Singapore Institute of Technology. 
I am currently experiencing and learning what it is like to be engineer. Re-learning what the ways i study and learn new information so that they can stick for the long term and i am able to utilize them for different situations. 

I am keen and eager to learn new things and am currently developing a growth mindset, and would like to hear about potential career opportunities, so I would be pleased to chat about projects and learn more about robotics and systems, how they work together.

My area of expertise includes:
Basics in C (programming language)
Basics in Python
Teamwork
Critical Thinking
